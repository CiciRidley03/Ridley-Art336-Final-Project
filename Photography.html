                    <p>This is a picture of a leaf that has fallen on the outside of the apartments in Southern Maryland. The time of day was early afternoon after a small shower of rain. The photo was taken on my Iphone 5. </p>

                    <p>This is a picture of a brown raw egg with string cheese laying over it. This was taken inside my apartment, which has a dark yellow tint to the overall picture. I then changed it to grayscale to focus more on the highlights and shadows. The photo was taken on my Canon Rebel T3i 35mm camera. </p>
